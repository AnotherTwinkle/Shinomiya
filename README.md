Shinomiya is the go-to bot for The Motherland of Degeneratia.


To run the bot, create a file called `config.py` with the following template:

```py
token = '' # The bot's token.
owner_ids = [] # (Optional) A list of bot owners.
```

Now, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Better if you are in a venv)
