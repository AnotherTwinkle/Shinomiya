Shinomiya is a bot built for the Kaguya-sama: love is war fandom with <3 and care.
This can be also seen as a open-source recreation of the Aibot's kaguya features.

To run the bot, create a file called `config.py` with the following template:

```py
token = '' # The bot's token.
owner_ids = [] # (Optional) A list of bot owners.
```
